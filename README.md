The repository for Conditional-Pooling paper.
Brief description of Conditional-Pooling: Conditional-Pooling is an innovative pooling technique designed to enhance feature extraction and representation within deep learning models, particularly in the field of computer vision. It differs from traditional pooling methods like average and max pooling by dynamically considering the distribution of pixel values relative to their mean. By assigning greater weight to pixels exceeding the mean, Conditional-Pooling adaptively captures salient features, making it highly effective in scenarios involving complex visual data with inherent noise and variability. This technique has shown significant promise in improving the performance of deep neural networks across various image-related tasks, making it a valuable addition to the toolkit of machine learning practitioners and researchers.
